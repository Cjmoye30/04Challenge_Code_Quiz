# JavaScript Code Quiz!

## Description

- What was your motivation?
    - My motivation for this project was to come up with a simple interactive quiz which mimics other multiple choice quizzes I've taken in my life.
    - The acceptance and grading criteria are simple - creating a multiple choice quiz which progresses through questions, tracks the users score, and then logs that score into a highscores table.

- Why did you build this project?
    - I build this project to continue to build my skills using JavaScript. Before delving fully into JQuery and other APIs/Libraries, it is essential to learn the basics of "Vanilla JavaScript".

- What problem does it solve?
    - I now how a webpage built which functions correctly using multiple query selectors, event listeners, objects, and creating/appending elements to an HTML page.

- What did you learn?
    - HTML: 
        - Computational Thinking - breaking this entire project down into small tasks and then tackling one by one. Example - putting together the bare minimum in the header and introduction sections before progressing to the quiz or final score sections
        - Starting off with the bare minimum HTML/CSS is very important before moving to JS. Often, it seems very easy to get caught up styling the page when that is not of the most importance.
    - JavaScript:
        - Similar to the HTML/CSS - making sure to tackle the basic requirements before proceeding to anything more difficult
        - The importance of using multiple functions. Having many different functions allows debugging to be easier, and helps to break the code down into smaller bits.
        - Gained better practice using and accessing JS objects
        - Must have at the minimum an empty return value if you want a function to stop after a condition is met in an if statement. First occurance in the runQuiz() function in order to stop the quiz from progressing when the index is reached - otherwise it will throw an error.
        - Gained a better understanding of setTimeout functions - the delay of 250ms is enough to show the result of the current question and quick enough to proceed to the next question.
        - Append child is very easy - just need to locate the div or HTML element that you want to append to.
        - Time Interval as a global variable - by removing the var keyword from the setTime() function, you are able to clear the interval from anywhere in the JS file rather than only locally within the function.

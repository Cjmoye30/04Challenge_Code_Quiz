    <!-- Acceptance Criteria - MVP
            GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
            WHEN I click the start button
            THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
            WHEN I answer a question
            THEN I am presented with another question
            WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
            THEN time is subtracted from the clock
            WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
            THEN the game is over
            WHEN the game is over
            THEN I can save my initials and my score
    -->

    <!-- Steps Needed:
        -Header Section:
            Placeholder for time left
            Link to highscores

        - Intro: MVP Met
            > The page the user views as soon as they reach our webpage
            > Have an introductory heading and paragraph explaining the quiz
            > Include a start quiz button which makes the intro dissapead and then begins the quiz
            >

        - Quiz Section: MVP Met
            > Once loaded, the first question pops in
            > Create objects within JS which contains all of the questions and the correct answers.
            > Keep a tally (variable) for correct and incorrect answers
            > Add in a delay before shwoing the next question
            > When a question is answered, the result of that answer appears at the bottom section of the question choices before proceeding
            > Once the quiz is completed, we then go to the closing section to discuss the reuslts

        - Closing Section: MVP Met
            > Show the final score as a percentage and with a raw tally
            > Allow the user to store their initials in a variable which we can then push to another dashboard
            > The highscores dashboard can be an array which we push initials and scores to - so that it is dynamic and can grow without us having to go into the code to increase parameters
            > Once highscores are submitted, have the buttons/options to go back and re-take the quiz

        - Timeout Function
            > Create a timer which ticks down by 1 second at a time and the inner html is updated
            > If the timer reaches 0 and the quiz is not completed, then an alert is announced and the user is automatically taken.

        - Left to do:
            > Have a button which returns to the home page without resetting anything so that you can keep the high scores in tact - this way if the user wants to view the instructions about how this operates then they can do that.
            > Have the input field for the initials dissapear after high scores submission so there is not duplicate value entered
            > If the value of the initials entered already matches something already entered, then throw an error and have the user re-enter their initials or name
            > Style for screen sizes.
            > Reduce timeout function so that there is a smaller chance of spam clicking and breaking the quiz.
            > Add in question numbers which are pulling from the qIndex + 1
            > Add in more questions and have them related to actual coding topics
